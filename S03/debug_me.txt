The problem lies in the fact that in the function "f(a, b, c, d)", the operation "t2" can give rise to a
ZeroDivisionError. This is because the definition of "t2" contains the operation "(t0/t1)", which are themselves
variables given by the sum and substraction of the given parameters ("(a, b, c, d)"). Therefore, there are cases where
t1 can be equal to cero (those where the parameters c and d are equal, since t1 = c - d).
